Where dreams are made. 

## Getting Started
**Creating the AndroidStudio Project**

Create a new project from this git repository. 

1. From the startup screen, 
select  "Check out project from Version Control." 
2. From *File > New*, 
select "(New) Project from Version Control." 

In either case, enter the git clone URL when prompted. You will need to 
authenticate with your x500 and password. 

If the git authentication works out, the project will automatically 
download all sources and run a build. 

**Making a branch**

To avoid disaster, we should all work on our own branches. 

In the bottom right of the screen, you should text that says "Git: 
master". 

Click it, select "New Branch", and give it a helpful name. 

The text in the bottom right should change to "Git: branch-name" if 
successful. 

**Git tips** 

When you would like to commit, type *cmd-k* or *ctrl-k*. 

Type *cmd-shift-k* or *ctrl-shift-k* to push your commits to the 
repository. 

## Using the app
Currently, the login doesn't verify anything, except that the password 
field has a 5+ character entry.
